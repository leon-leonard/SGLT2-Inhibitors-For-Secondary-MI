# SGLT2-Inhibitors-for-Secondary-MI

**Background** 

Survivors of myocardial infarction (MI) remain at high risk of recurrent events despite
standard secondary prevention. Although studies suggest that SGLT2 inhibitors reduce major cardiovas-
cular events, their specific efficacy for secondary MI, timing of benefit, and real-world adherence remain
unclear. This study evaluated the clinical impact and adherence behaviours of SGLT2 inhibitors among
MI survivors.

**Methods**

The data was drawn from a randomised controlled trial of 1988 MI survivors assigned to
SGLT2 inhibitors plus usual care or usual care alone, with follow-up over five years. The primary end-
points were time to secondary MI and systolic blood pressure at 12 months, with medication adherence
also assessed. Multivariable logistic regression, time-dependent Cox proportional hazards models, and
multivariable linear regression were used.

**Results** 

Pre-randomisation BMI was the only factor associated with adherence, with higher BMI
increasing the odds of adherence (OR 1.06; 95% CI: 1.02-1.10; p=0.004). SGLT2 inhibitor treatment
reduced the overall hazard of secondary MI by 22% (HR 0.78; 95% CI: 0.67-0.91; p=0.002). However,
this effect was time-dependent: no benefit was observed in the first 1.5 years (HR 1.38; 95% CI: 0.83-
2.29; p=0.22), but a 27% hazard reduction emerged between 1.5 and 5 years (HR 0.73; 95% CI: 0.62-0.87;
p<0.001). Systolic blood pressure decreased by an average of 1.9 mmHg (95% CI: -2.61 to -1.20; p<0.001).

**Conclusion**

SGLT2 inhibitors are an effective treatment for secondary prevention of MI, although
their benefits are most pronounced after 1.5 years of treatment. Strategies that encourage long-term
adherence, particularly in patients with lower BMI, may enhance clinical outcomes.
